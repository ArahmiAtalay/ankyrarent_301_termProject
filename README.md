**Short Definition:** Designing a website for to meet the basic requirements of a local car rental business. <br />
**Short Explanation:** A general website that allows customers to analyze available cars, rent them and contact with owners for a local rent a car business, and in this sense brings users and business owners together.<br />
**Used Programs/Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript. <br />
**Other Supporter Tools (Integrated with Website):** Owl Carousel, Disqus, JivoChat, Momento360, Netlify. <br /> <br />
**Project Process:** In this project, we have progressed by addressing what a car rental site may need and 
further our work in this direction. First of all, we worked on what kind of structure our site 
should have. For example, we decided which elements should be in our site and where these 
elements should be located. Afterwards, we made different experiments outside the project in 
order to create these elements. As a result, we have a sketch on paper to create the website. 
Using these drafts and the data we obtained from our previous works, we created the basic 
structure of our website with HTML structure. Afterwards, we visually enriched the HTML 
structures we have using CSS. At this point we would like to add: since we learned and 
experienced some things during the project, not all HTML structures could be enriched with 
CSS in a synchronous way, in short, trial and error method was used. After the HTML&CSS 
structure was created, we used JavaScript structure for the slider section on our site. At this 
point, we got help from OwlCarousel and jQuery. OwlCarousel is a jQuery plugin that
provides many services such as multimedia, presentation, and demonstration on sites. Thanks 
to these codes, we created the slider part of our project completely and then we made the 
improvements that the slider part needed in terms of visuality. At this point, our website was 
basically ready, but its images such as icons, advertisements, etc. we’re not fully ready. Here, 
we have collected the missing images from the three branches, as well as edited and 
harmonized the images we already have. Afterwards, we integrated these images to the 
relevant places in our project and completed our vehicle announcements. Afterwards, we 
worked on the showroom area on our site, which is in development beta. Here, we got help 
from the website called Momento360. We converted the panoramic photo you uploaded on 
this site into a 360-degree photo format and we completed the 360-degree vehicle review 
integration to our site with the script code we obtained from here. Then we added the online 
help support tool to our site via JivoChat. JivoChat is a website that provides online and 
offline help tools to sites. We have completed this integration by adding the script code we 
received from this site to our project. Finally, we have done research to ensure that our 
website is published in the real world. As a result of our research, we reached the site called 
Netlify. Netlify used to offer free solutions for website publishing. That's why we've 
published our website here and observed how it works in the real world. <br /> <br />
